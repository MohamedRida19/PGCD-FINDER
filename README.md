## ⚡ Project Overview
**Polynomial GCD Finder** is a Python-based graphical application for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two polynomials. It utilizes the SymPy library for symbolic mathematics and a user-friendly graphical interface built with customtkinter.

This project is designed to simplify polynomial operations, such as GCD calculation, quotient and remainder division, and allows users to input polynomial expressions in a readable format with Unicode superscripts.. It aims to simplify calculating the pgcd of two polynomes and give a good experience to the user.

## 🛠 Features (Planned & Current)
- [x] input directly your polynomes in the inputs section  
- [x] get your result directly in the screen  
- [ ] keyboard will simplify the writting of the complexe expressions *(in progress)*  
- [ ] an apk app for phones *(coming soon)*
